				    <h1>Edward Chen</h1>
				    <h3> echen52 (at) illinois (dot) edu </h3>
				    <p>
				    	Welcome to my website! I'm an experienced data scientist based in the Dallas area, currently seeking new opportunities in data science and analytics, particularly in tech-forward or product-focused environments.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	From 2017 to 2024, I worked at USAA Federal Savings Bank on the Bank Credit Risk Modeling team, ultimately serving as a Senior Data Scientist. During my time at USAA, I led development on the bank’s first machine learning model for credit risk decisioning and designed a framework to generate credit card adverse action reasons using Shapley values and partial dependence plots.
				    </p>
				     <p>
				    	In 2025, I joined Citi as a Senior Model Validation Analyst, where I worked on model governance and validation for machine learning and statistical models used in customer analytics and credit risk applications.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I also hold an M.S. in Statistics from Texas A&M University (2021) and a B.A. in Mathematics and Economics from Cornell University (2017). I have extensive experience with SAS, SQL, and Python, and working proficiency in Java, R, and C.

				</li>
				</ul>

		    <h2> Interests </h2>
				Outside of work, I enjoy playing basketball in my local rec league, watching football, and spending time with my family and dog. I'm also a longtime fan of retro gaming—especially older Pokémon titles—and enjoy building personal projects at the intersection of data science, gaming, and sports analytics.
