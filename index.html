				    <p>
				    	Hello and welcome to my website! I am an experienced data scientist based out of the Dallas area currently looking for new opportunities in the data science space.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	From 2017-2024, I worked for USAA Federal Savings Bank in the Bank Credit Risk Modeling team, most recently as a Senior Data Scientist. At USAA, I helped to develop the bank's first ever machine learning model for credit risk decisions, and provided a framework for credit card adverse action reasons using Shapley values and partial dependence values.
				    </p>
				    <p>
				    	I am currently working on my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I received a M.S. in Statistics from Texas A&M University in 2021 and graduated with my B.A. in Mathematics and Economics from Cornell University in 2017. I have extensive experience working with SAS, SQL, and Python as well as working proficiency in Java, R, and C.
